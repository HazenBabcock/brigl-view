
Brigl-View, a wrapper of the Brigl WebGL renderer for LDraw models
==================================================================

Brigl-View wraps the Brigl library to create a LDraw model viewer
that lets you select sub-models from a MPD file. It also allows
you to go through the build steps for a model and shows you what
parts are added at each step.

Note
====

The initial loading can be slow, particularly if you have a large
model. It can look like nothing is happening for 1-2 minutes. However
once the model is loaded everything should work fairly quickly, at
least on desktop computer.
